# DCS Export Tool

Console application for players of Digital Combat Simulator to export clikcable cockpit data with IDs into table per module.
Enables users to input proper control and device IDs to other tools, like StreamDeck with **StreamDeck DCS Interface**

## What it does
- Scans installed modules and lists them in the console
- (TBD) Reads clickable cockpit data from the LUA scripts of the modules with common folder structure (most of the module, unlike Mirage F-1)
- (TBD) Exports the data into CSV
- (TBD) Exports the data into table on HTML page
