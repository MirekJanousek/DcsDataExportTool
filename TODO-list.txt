General
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- change steps limits to nullable values instead of Min of number
- change other models numeric values to nullables

Module lookup
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Export problems
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- defined class types are not containing all of them
	- some modules have other types too. Is the class types definition needed per module?

- some LEV elements have value for step in gain instead of arg_value
	- maybe when arg_value = 0 than look for the step value in gain


M-2000C:

- some elements do not have limits => change code so that limits are not required

AV8B:

- Nozzle Control Lever should have step of 0.1, not 0 (arg_value vs. gain problem)

P-51

- Does not have devices defined on elements (maybe only some?)
